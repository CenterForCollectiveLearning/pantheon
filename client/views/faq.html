				<h2>What defines culture?</h2>
				<p>We broadly define culture as the information that is generated by human creativity, and transmitted through non-genetic means. Culture ranges from the shared norms and beliefs of societies, to the knowledge and information that leads to the development of modern science and technology.</p>
				<h2>What is the significance of global culture?</h2>
				<p>Global culture encompasses the cultural expressions that have broken many linguistic barriers - as compared to local culture, which is information that is contained within a few select language groups. </p>
				<h2>How are individuals attributed to countries? Does the data take immigration into account?</h2>
				<p>Currently, we attribute individuals by their country of birth - based on current geography. This means that Albert Einstein is an export of Germany, and individuals born in the ancient city of Babylon are associated with Iraq. </p>
                <h2>What about the inherent biases within Wikipedia? </h2>
                <p>Although there are <a href="data.html">limitations</a> to the use of Wikipedia as a source of cultural data, it is the most comprehensive set of collaborative, multi-lingual human knowledge currently available. The global patterns presented within this observatory should be considered within the context of the known biases within Wikipedia.</p>
                <h2>Is this project open source? How can I access the dataset?</h2>
                <p>In the first release of this project, we encourage viewers to give us feedback and <a href="faq.html">contribute</a> to the project. We plan on open sourcing the visualization engine and supporting datasets in a future release.</p>
