	<h2>The Data</h2>			
	<p>This is a site about culture, and about empirical measures of cultural development. Yet, this is not a site about all culture, or a site that is by any means free of biases. Creating quantitative measures of cultural development has been historically difficult. After all, culture encompasses the entire range of possible human activities. Certainly, quantifying the properties of such a diverse set will not be easy, and any approach attempting to do so will be filled with limitations and biases that will be hard to overcome. A detailed list and explanation of the different biases that need to be considered when interpreting this data is available in the limitations section. We recommend this as required reading for any critic of the work, since the criticisms that we welcome the most are those that do not simply highlight biases that we are already aware of.</p>
	<p>But why embark in a herculean data collection task knowing that the end result will be filled with biases? The underlying assumption here is that, although biases are prevalent, and strong enough to distort the signal, they do not provide the bulk of the signal. In other words, the assumption is that the patterns that are observed in the data, and described here, paint a picture of reality that is worth looking at despite the noise of the instrument. It is a landscape that is worth looking into despite the dirt on the window, a night sky that is worth exploring despite the limited telescope.</p>
	<p>Finally, we hope that the creation of this dataset, visualizations and measures, help illuminate the path of future researchers looking to perform similar data collection efforts. Ultimately, the best way to address the biases of the dataset we present here is by constructing a dataset that is less biased than the one being presented. Certainly, the task is not easy, since it implies a measure of the biases, and hence, a comparison with a dataset that is free of them. Our hope here is that our current effort to measure cultural development helps illuminate the path of those attempting to approach this aspect of nature in the future, and that the biases and mistakes made here, help future researchers avoid these limitations.</p>
	<h2>Data Collection Method</h2>
	<p>To measure the impact and development of cultural expressions, we would ideally use data that encompasses collective global human knowledge about all cultural expressions, with high spatiotemporal resolution and disaggregated across a standardized cultural classification schema. For this Observatory, we chose to use data available from Freebase and Wikipedia. Both of these sources are open-source, collaborative knowledge bases freely available online to the general public. While there are certainly considerable limitations to these sources (see <b>Data Limitations</b>), they are currently the only datasets available that represent large, domain-independent repositories of collaboratively edited human knowledge, and past research has demonstrated the reliability of these collaborative knowledge bases (Giles 2005, Spinellis and Louridas 2008). </p>
	<p>We derive our dataset of cultural exports from Freebase’s entity knowledge graph and metadata available via the Wikipedia API. Freebase organizes information as uniquely identified entities with associated types and properties defined by a structured data ontology. Therefore, to identify historical and current cultural figures, we first determined a list of individuals through Freebase’s database of all entities classified as Persons. The individuals are filtered based on the availability of personal and demographic details, including birthdate, birthplace, gender, and occupation. These individuals are then linked to the relevant entries within English Wikipedia using their unique Wikipedia article id, and we leverage the Wikipedia API to obtain the linkages to other Wikipedia language editions. </p>
	<p>After extracting the initial dataset, we further refined the data through both programmatic and manual cleaning processes. In order to resolve each individual to a standardized geographic location, we generalize each person to a country based on their city of birth and nationality, using a combination of various web geocoding APIs (including Yahoo Placemaker, Google Maps, and geonames.org). Individuals born in historical locales are mapped to the current equivalent – for example, individuals born within the former Soviet Union are mapped to current countries such as Russia. In some cases, additional manual corrections are applied to enhance the accuracy of the location matching. </p>
	<p>Another important consideration for this dataset is the classification schema used to categorize the cultural contributions of each individual. We use occupation to derive the domain in which an individual contributes their cultural expressions. Two issues arise from the initial data – many individuals who have contributed to multiple cultural domains are linked to more than one occupation, and individuals may be linked to occupations that are not within the domain of their most significant cultural contribution. An extensive manual curation effort on this data attempts to mitigate these issues. First, for all individuals with more than 25 language editions on Wikipedia, we manually attribute them to a single occupation – for instance, Barack Obama is classified as a politician within the dataset, since his main contributions are within the domain of politics, despite also having a secondary occupation as a writer. Further, we reviewed the occupations of individuals with more than 25 language editions on Wikipedia to ensure that individuals are assigned to their requisite professions – so Osama bin Laden is categorized as an extremist, instead of an engineer. Using the complete set of normalized occupations, we constructed a classification scheme to group occupations by industry and cultural domain. The interactive figure below shows the three levels of cultural classifications as well as the number of individuals within each category.</p>

	<h2>Data Limitations</h2>
	<p>This dataset has an important number of limitations that should be considered carefully when interpreting the results. By acknowledging these limitations we make clear that we do not propose this method as the best possible way to measure cultural expressions and cultural development, but as a method that can help provide an approximation to these measures with the data that is currently available, and with the resources at our disposal. The limitations of the data include:</p>
	<h3>Limitations of the use of the Wikipedia as the source of Notoriety</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> <p>Who writes in Wikipedia?</p><p>The dataset is certainly limited and constrained by the set of people who contribute to Wikipedia. We do not consider Wikipedia editors to be a representative sample of the world population, but a sample of publicly minded knowledge specialists that are willing to dedicate time and effort to contribute to this online resource.</p></li>
		<li> <p>English bias.</p><p>The original list of 215,925 biographies was collected from Freebase. This list is restricted to biographies with a presence in the English Wikipedia, which is the largest Wikipedia currently in existence. We acknowledge that there are people that have presence in the Wikipedia but not necessarily in the English edition. We remind the reader that the dataset is restricted to those biographies that have a presence in at least 25 different language editions. Those biographies are highly likely to contain English as one of its languages, since English is the largest and most visited of all Wikipedia editions.</p></li>
		<li> <p>Computer Access and Income Bias.</p><p>The contributors to an online resource like the Wikipedia are, by definition, people with access to computers and an internet connection. This certainly is highly correlated with a high level of income, and with a proficiency in the use of computers.</p></li>
		<li> <p>Notoriety criteria and its relation with cultural domain</p><p>We note that the inclusion of people in the Wikipedia is based on notoriety, and that this notoriety is not independent from the cultural domain of the participants. For instance, the Spanish Wikipedia has entries for 78% of the players in the Chilean soccer club Unión Española, but only for 5.5% of the faculty at MIT.</p></li>
		<li> <p>Bias against oral cultures</p><p>Certainly, cultures that transmit information mostly orally are underrepresented in the Wikipedia, and in our dataset.</p></li>
		<li> <p>Western bias</p><p>The Wikipedia is known to have a Western bias (Callahan and Herring 2011)</p></li>
		<!li> <p>Recency bias</p><p>The dataset considered has an important recency bias. As a matter of example, the figures below show the number of language editions for each Chilean president as a function of the year in which they took office, the number of language editions for each “pichici” (top scorer) of the Spanish Liga, and the number of language editions for each winner of best actress award at the Oscars. All three data series demonstrate a positive correlation for the current presence of these individuals in Wikipedia with their year of birth. </p>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Limitations of the location assignment method</h3>
	<p>Individuals where assigned to geographic locations using a combination of automated methods and manual curation (see <b>Data Collection Method</b>). Limitations that go beyond the errors involved in the processing of these records include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <p>Cultural Re-Exports</p><p>Certainly, the place where an individual was born is often different from the place where that individual made his or her more important contributions. In some case, the contributions are made in a number of places. This is particularly true for athletes who migrate to the world’s most competitive leagues, or artists that move to the cultural centers of their time. In this dataset, such cultural re-exports are not represented due to technical limitations, since programmatically geo-coding birth-places is easier and more reliable than registering the place where each individual made his or her more significant contribution.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Limitations based on the use of Biographies</h3>
	<p>Certainly, using biographies to approximate cultural expressions is an approach that is limited to accomplishments where there is a clear connection between a cultural expression and an author. This is not always the case, since some important cultural expression can result from collective groups. For example, in music the notoriety of a band or an orchestra can be poorly approximated by the notoriety of its most memorable members.</p>
	<h3>Limitations of the Cultural Domain classification</h3>
	<p>The cultural domains associated to each biography are based on a hand-curated classification, which was constructed through careful inspection of more than 4,000 individual biographies. The need to use a hand curated classification stemmed from the lack of a previous classification that could be applied, and from the limitations of the available data. The classification started with the occupation data available in Freebase, which is based on an uncontrolled vocabulary. This uncontrolled vocabulary of more than 2,200 categories was mapped into a controlled vocabulary. Later, each of the individuals with multiple categories was assigned to a single category. For example, Margaret Thatcher, who appears as a “chemist” and a “politician”, was assigned “politician” as her primary category. This certainly is an oversimplification given the large number of polymaths. We nevertheless decided to avoid the use of a polymath category since we consider this to be a slippery slope category, as one could almost always draw the line a bit further and include more biographies in the polymath category. Because of this, Isaac Newton is listed as a “physicist” and not a “mathematician” and Leonardo da Vinci as an “inventor” and not as a “painter”, “designer”, “sculptor” or “architect”. The use of a primary cultural domain for each individual also helps avoid double counting. Going forward, we will include a participatory method to help users decide on the different cultural domains of each biographical character.</p>
	<h3>Other Technical Limitations</h3>
	<p>In addition to the biases mentioned above, there are technical biases that involve the use of Wikipedia as a data source. For instance, the Wikipedia is a volatile resource, making the results presented here imperfectly reproducible. Moreover, sometimes Wikipedia IDs redirect to groups (such as music bands), which might lead to overestimate the number of languages in which each of the group members has a presence.</p>
