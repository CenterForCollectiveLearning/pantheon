				<h2 id="general_idea">General Idea</h2>

				<p>The measures we present here are based on simple, implementable, quantitative measures of culture. For simplicity, we take the online presence of historical figures as a Proxy for their accomplishments, since it is easier to track the online presence of J.K. Rowling than that of each of the characters she created.</p>

				<p>The simplest of all our measures is the number of Wikipedia language editions that have an article about a historical figure. We consider the presence of a character in many languages to be important because this allows us to separate global culture from local culture. Characters that have contributed to local culture are often highly regarded by people from their own country or language, but are largely unknown to the rest of the world. At The Observatory of Global Culture we are not attempting to capture local culture--at least for now--but instead, we are focusing on the biographies of historical characters that have achieved global cultural notoriety, as expressed in the documentation of these biographies in a large number of languages. Examples of these biographies include characters of enormous historical weight, such as Isaac Newton, Van Gogh and Aristotle, who have articles in more than 150 Wikipedia language editions, but also more recent contributors to global culture such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Albert Camus or Pablo Neruda, who have articles in more than 50 Wikipedia language editions.</p>

				<p>In addition to the number of languages we are exploring other metrics--which we have yet to integrate into the visualizations. These include the pageviews of a historical character’s Wikipedia pages, the number of people that have contributed to the article, and the frequency of the edits, among other things.  Also, we have constructed metrics that include different normalizations. For instance, we consider the number of speakers associated with each of the languages in which a biography has a Wikipedia presence as a way to consider more strongly languages associated with larger populations. Going forward, we consider these measures to be refinements of the general idea that measures of global impact need to focus on accomplishments that have broken several linguistic and cultural barriers, and hence, that the most important bias that we need to step aside from is that from using a monolingual source.</p>

				<p>Our dataset does not only contain information on biographies, and the number of languages associated with them. To create the Observatory of Global Culture we have also gone through the painstaking process needed to associate each character to a location, based on the character’s place of birth, and to a cultural domain, based on a hand curated classification that is based in roughly 100 different cultural domains. These domains include activities in the entire range of human expressions, from astronauts to soccer players, and from politicians to biologists.</p>

				<p>The Observatory of Cultural development is a new structured data set and visualization engine constructed to help anyone explore the cultural development of a country, or a cultural domain. Ultimately, by creating explicit measures of the human achievements of each country, we are hoping to promote the use of cultural achievements as a measure of national and global development.</p>

				<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h2></h2>
				<p>This Observatory was constructed from data that we curated and collected from Freebase and Wikipedia. Both of these sources are open-source, collaborative knowledge bases that are freely available to the general public. </p>

				<p>Our dataset is centered around historical characters. Characters are annotated with a unique location--their place of birth-, time period--date of birth--, cultural domain, and notoriety metrics.</p>

				<h2 id="individuals_considered">Individuals Considered</h2>

				<p>We consider all individuals that have presence in at least 25 different language editions of the Wikipedia by XXXX date. This set consists of 11,YYY individuals.</p>

				<h2 id="domain_categorization">Domain Categorization</h2>

				<p>We derive the domain of an individual's cultural contribution using incomplete data and iterative curation procedures. </p>

				<p>To create this classification we used the occupation data available in Freebase, which is based on an uncontrolled vocabulary (a biography for a film director could be annotated as a “Film Director”, “Movie director”, “Director of Films” or any other natural language way of referring to that occupation). This uncontrolled vocabulary of more than 2,200 categories was mapped into a controlled vocabulary that we grouped and regrouped iteratively to create a controlled categorization. This required us to assign each individual to a single category, a task that was easy in some cases, but limiting in others. For example, Margaret Thatcher, who appears as a “chemist” and a “politician”, was assigned “politician” as her primary category. This was an easy call to make. We listed Isaac Newton, on the other hand,  as a “physicist”, although a mathematician category would also be correct for many of his important contributions. This is a limitation given the large number of polymaths in the data. Yet, we decided to avoid using a polymath category because it represents a “slippery slope”. By a slippery slope we mean that one could almost always draw the polymath line a bit further and include more biographies in the polymath category, making the boundary of such a mixed category unclear. The use of a primary cultural domain for each individual also helps avoid double counting. Using multiple categories for an individual is something we will reconsider in the future, but that will not be part of this first dataset. </p>

				<p>The interactive figure below shows the three levels of cultural classifications as well as the number of individuals within each category.</p>

				[CATEGORIES FIGURE HERE]

				<p>Since in the Observatory of Global Culture we are introducing this new categorization (the OGC 1.0 if you may), it is important to highlight some conventions that are not necessarily self-explanatory. The most important of these is the “Politician” category, which we used to include all individuals that had power over policies, whether these were presidents, pharaos, emperors or state governors. We chose the word politician, in relation to policies, rather than the word leader because there are leaders that exist outside of formal government structures. Going forward, we are open to continue to revise this categorization system to help improve the quality of the data and the results obtained from it.</p>

				<h2 id="location_assignment">Location assignment</h2>

				<p>We assigned each individual to a standardized geographic location through a procedure that included incomplete datasets, algorithmic completion of these datasets, and refinement of these datasets through manual curation. </p>

				<p>We begun the location assignment procedure by collecting the city and nationality information from freebase. This is incomplete unnormalized data, meaning that for many individuals the information is missing or represented using an uncontrolled vocabulary--for instance an individual's city of birth could be labeled as new york, New York, New York City, or Manhattan, N.Y. We normalized the vocabulary in the data using various web geocoding APIs (including Yahoo Placemaker, Google Maps, and geonames.org) and mapped individuals born in historical locales to the countries where those cities are are currently located–-for example, we mapped individuals born in Moscow during the Soviet Union to Moscow, Russia. Finally, we manually curated the dataset to correct for the errors of the automated procedures.</p>

				<p>We understand that assigning individuals to their location based on their place of birth is highly controversial, even though the goal of the procedure is simplicity rather than controversy. The procedure was also chosen for convenience, since as of now, given our throughput and capacities, we have no other way to feasible map more than 11 thousand biographies to locations with little to no margin of error. In the future, we hope to consider the life trajectory of individuals, and the places where they made their contributions, but this will not be part of this first version. The assignment of locations based on place of birth is rife with assignments that could be considered controversial. Ataturk is associated with Greece, because he was born on the city of Thessaloniki that is part of present day Greece. The chilean writer Isabel Allende is associated with Peru, since she was born in Lima. Brazil, gets credit for the biologist Peter Medawar, since he was born in Rio.</p>

				<h2 id="biases_and_limitations">Biases and Limitations</h2>

				<p>This section describes the biases and limitations of the data in This Observatory. These limitations that should be considered carefully when interpreting the results. By acknowledging these limitations we make clear that we do not propose this method to represent an unbiased view of the world. On the contrary, as all large data collection efforts, it is an effort that is marked by limitations and biases. Some of these biases are mechanical and hard to correct, and could be compared to the optical aberrations of a telescope, other biases, however, are informative about the processes that affect the notoriety of historical characters. In this section, we will not discuss the implications of each bias and limitation, but will simply describe and classify all of the biases that are part of this data collection effort.</p>

				<p>Going forward we classify the biases and limitation in six categories. These are biases coming from </p>

				<ul>
					<li>1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source. </li>
					<li>2. The use of place of birth to assign locations.</li>
					<li>3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture.</li>
					<li>4. Temporal biases.</li>
					<li>5. Other technical limitations.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source</h3>

				<p>Our data is limited by the set of people who contribute to Wikipedia. We do not consider Wikipedia editors to be a representative sample of the world population, but a sample of publicly minded knowledge specialists that are willing to dedicate time and effort to contribute to the online documentation of knowledge. Wikipedia editors have an English Bias, a Western Bias, and they tend to be highly educated and computer savy. They are also more prevalent among richer countries with internet access. We remind the reader, however, that by using data in all languages in which the Wikipedia has a presence, we are greatly reducing a bias that would favor the local culture of English speakers. As an example of the global emphasis introduced by the requirement of a presence in at least 25 languages, and the reduction of emphasis of the local culture of English speaking nations, we note that there is only one American Football Player in the dataset: O.J. Simpson. Certainly, his global notoriety is not the result purely from his football career, showing that the use of many languages reduces the English bias of the dataset.</p>

				<p>The Wikipedia also has an important bias in the inclusion of people from different categories. This bias could be the result of the notoriety criteria in Wikipedia being more lax for individuals in some categories than others, or from the Wikipedia community.  For instance, we note that Spanish Wikipedia has entries for 78% of the players in the Chilean soccer club Unión Española, and 43% of the players from the second division team Magallanes, but only for 5.5% of the faculty at MIT.</p>

				<h3>2. The use of place of birth to assign locations</h3>

				<p>Individuals were assigned to geographic locations using their place of birth. Since neither Freebase nor Wikipedia have comprehensive date of birth data, the place of birth assignments were complemented with geocoding APIs for normalization and manual curation (to correct for errors in API and completeness).</p>

				<p>Place of birth is one way of assigning a location to an individual that allow us to assign locations in a comprehensive manner. Yet, there are biases and limitations that need to be considered when using this location assignment method. An important limitation is the inability to include cultural re-exports. Would Neruda, Picasso or Hemingway be as famous if they had not participated of the Parisian art scene? The place where an individual was born is often different from the place where that individual made his or her more important contributions. In some case, the contributions are made in a number of places, and the use of places of births is unable to capture where the contributions were made. This is particularly true for athletes who migrate to the world’s most competitive leagues, or artists that move to the artistic centers of their time. In this dataset, such cultural re-exports are not represented since programmatically geo-coding birthplaces is easier and more reliable than registering the place where each individual made his or her more significant contribution.</p>

				<h3>3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture</h3>

				<p>Using biographies to approximate cultural expressions excludes accomplishments where there isn’t a clear connection between a cultural expression and an author or creator. These are collective enterprises, where the accomplishments are the results of teams and not isolated individuals.  Examples of team accomplishments that are likely to get excluded include include music bands or orchestras, when the most notorious individuals has a notoriety that is much smaller than that of the band, or the products produced by a firm, where the accolades collected from accomplishments are connected to a firm or brand rather than to an individual. </p>

				<h3>4. Temporal biases</h3>

				<p>The dataset has an important recency bias. To illustrate and document this recency bias we show three datasets in which we consider individuals with a “similar” level of accomplishment. These are Chilean president, the “pichicis”--top scorer--of the Spanish Liga, and the winners of the best actress award at the Oscars. All three data series demonstrate a positive correlation between the number of languages in which these individuals have a presence and the year of their birth, indicating that the dataset is biased in favor of more recent individuals. </p>

				<p>The recency bias is an interesting bias because it is also a bias of the media. It is reasonable to expect that people whose fame coincided with the existence of the internet to be overrepresented in the Wikipedia. Hence, the bias can be understood as a combination of both, a bias for recency, but also, a bias of the media available at the time in which the individual became notorious for a contribution.</p>

				<h3>5. Other Technical Limitations</h3>

				<p>Other biases and limitations include the volatility of Wikipedia, which makes the results presented here imperfectly reproducible. </p>
