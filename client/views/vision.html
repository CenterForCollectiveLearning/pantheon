		<h2>Mapping humanity’s greatest achievements</h2>
		<p>Measuring development is difficult.  Most of the widely accepted measures of progress, such as GDP per capita or the Human Development Index, are aggregates in which wealth, health and education are mixed together, but where people’s activities and achievements are not considered.</p>
		<p>Our civilization, however, has been able to achieve much more than providing services and purchasing power to an increasing population. Our history is punctuated by achievements, from the works of Leonardo da Vinci to the footsteps of Neil Armstrong, and from the musical scale of Pythagoras to Newton’s Laws of Motion. </p>
		<p>But can we create measures of progress that take into account our culture’s achievements? Can we create measures of human progress that incorporate the development of music, literature, physics, astronomy, politics, theatre and sports? Can we create measures of human progress that focus on what we have been able to achieve, instead of what we lack?</p>
		<p>At the Observatory of Global Culture we are working on measures that focus on cultural achievements, adopting a definition of culture that encompasses the entire range of human expressions. We measure culture, by using the online presence of historical figures as a Proxy for accomplishments, since it is easier to track the online presence of J.K. Rowling than that of each of the characters she created. We approximate the impact of each historical figure by counting the number of Wikipedia language editions that have an article about them. For example, Isaac Newton, Van Gogh and Aristotle all have articles in more than 150 Wikipedia language editions, while Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Albert Camus or Pablo Neruda, have articles in more than 50 Wikipedia language editions.</p>
		<p>We have also gone through the painstaking process of associating each character to a location, based on the character’s place of birth, and to a cultural domain, based on a hand curated classification assigning each character to one of more than 100 different cultural domains: from astronauts to soccer players, and from politicians to biologists.</p>
		<p>The Observatory of Cultural development is a new data set and visualization engine constructed to help anyone explore the cultural development of a country, or a cultural domain. Ultimately, by creating explicit measures of the human achievements of each country, we are hoping to promote the use of cultural achievements as a measure of national and global development.</p>
