		<h1 id="vision">Vision</h1>
		<p>You were not born with the ability to fly, cure disease or communicate at long distances, but you were born in a society that endows you with these capacities. These capacities are the result of information that has been generated by humans and that humans have been able to embed in tangible and digital objects.</p>
		<p>This information is all around you. It is the way in which the atoms in an airplane are arranged or the way in which your cell-phone whispers dance instructions to electromagnetic waves. </p>
		<p>Pantheon is a project celebrating the cultural information that endows our species with these fantastic capacities. To celebrate our global cultural heritage we are compiling, analyzing and visualizing datasets that can help us understand the process of global cultural development. Dive in, visualize, and enjoy.</p>

		<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	</div>

	<p>This section contain bullet point answers for some of the most frequent questions. For a more thorough answer see the <a href="methods">methods</a> section.</p>

	<h2>What is culture?</h2>
	<p>Culture  is all information that is transmitted through non-genetic means. Culture ranges from the shared norms and beliefs of societies, to the knowledge and information that leads to the development of modern science and technology. It is the information that is transmitted orally, in texts, or in artifacts. Our measures of culture do not capture this definition of culture in its full extent, but a small subset of it. Namely, the one associated with accomplishments or historical periods that have a strong association with single individuals (see data).</p>

	<h2>What is global culture?</h2>
	<p>Global culture encompasses the cultural expressions that have broken many linguistic barriers--as compared to local culture, which is information that is contained within a few language groups. </p>

	<h2>How are individuals attributed to countries? Does the data take immigration into account?</h2>
	<p>Currently, we attribute individuals by their country of birth--based on current political maps. This means that Albert Einstein is an export of Germany (since he was born in Ulm) and that individuals born in the ancient city of Babylon were assigned to Iraq. </p>

	<h2>What about the inherent biases within Wikipedia? </h2>
	<p>Wikipedia data is rife with biases and limitations. Yet, these do not render it useless in absence of other comprehensive sources that can compete with Wikipedia in its coverage in both topics and number of languages included. A detailed description of these and other biases is available at: LINK</p>

	<h2>Is this project open source? How can I access the dataset?</h2>
	<p>In the first release of this project, we encourage viewers to give us feedback and contribute [link to question] to the project. We plan on open sourcing the visualization engine and supporting datasets in a future release.</p>

	<h2>This is awesome! How can I contribute to the effort?</h2>
	<p>Weâ€™d love your feedback! Help us improve by letting us know if anything is missing or incorrect, and participate in our community peer review by leaving comments on our working publications. And of course, feel free to spread the word and share the stories that you discover!</p>
