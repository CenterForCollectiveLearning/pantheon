			<p>Pantheon is a project developed by the Macro Connections group at The MIT Media Lab that's collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data on historical cultural popularity and production.</p>

			<p>Because of the diversity of cultural production, Pantheon will always be—by construction—an incomplete resource. This incompleteness, however, is the fuel that drives our team to continue compiling, refining, analyzing, and visualizing new sources of data.</p>

			<p>To make our efforts tractable, Pantheon will not focus on culture, as it is understood in its broadest sense, but on cultural production. In a broad sense, culture can be understood as all of the information that humans—or animals [1]—generate and transmit through non-genetic means [2]. At Pantheon, however, we do not focus on the entire range of cultural information, but in a subset of this information that we define narrowly as cultural production. That is, we do not focus on cultural information such as passed on family values or societal trust [3], but on cultural production as proxied by the biographies of notable historical characters. Moreover, we focus on the subset of cultural production that we can identify as <strong>global</strong> culture, meaning the subset of cultural production that has broken the barriers of space, time and language. By focusing on global culture we do not deny the existence of importance of local culture, but simply, choose to focus on global culture because it is a subset of the world’s cultural production that is relatively small, easy to map and of clear importance. </p>

			<p>The version 1.0 Pantheon—available starting March 2014—builds on two data sources, but was constructed to accommodate future data sources. The working draft of the Data Descriptor paper for the Pantheon 1.0 dataset is available on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07310">arXiv</a>.</p>

			<p>The two data sources included in this first version are:</p>

			<p><h2 id="data_source_1">Data Source 1:</h3> The Pantheon Multilingual Wikipedia Expression Dataset (or Pantheon Data 1.0) by Amy Yu, Kevin Hu, Shahar Ronen, Defne Gurel and Cesar A. Hidalgo (2013)</p>

			<p>The Pantheon 1.0 data was curated by the creators of Pantheon and gathers information on the 11,341 biographies that have presence in more than 25 languages in the Wikipedia (as of May 2013). This dataset is not restricted to any cultural domain or time period, including all biographies that are present in more than 25 different language editions of Wikipedia.</p>

			<p>The creation of the Pantheon 1.0 dataset included connecting each biography to a location using the country where the city of birth is presently located. Biographies were also connected to their date of birth—or an approximate date of birth when an exact date was not available—and a cultural domain, based on a categorization we developed specifically for this dataset. Details about the biases, limitations, coverage and validation of this dataset are described below.</p>

			<p><h2 id="data_source_2">Data Source 2:</h3> Human Accomplishment. The pursuit of excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800BC to 1950. By Charles Murray (2003) [4] </p>
			<p>Human Accomplishment is a book and a data compilation effort containing information on 3,896 eminent individuals from the arts and sciences who made a significant contribution prior to 1950. The inventories were constructed by Charles Murray using linguistic records—such as encyclopedia entries—from a number of different languages and sources. Human Accomplishment connects each of these historical figures to a location, time and cultural domain, albeit does so using a different methodology than the one we use for the Pantheon 1.0 data. </p>
			<p>During the data compilation face of the Pantheon project we connected both datasets at the level of individuals—a.k.a. historical figures.</p>
			<p>Details about the data in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Accomplishment-Pursuit-Excellence-Sciences/dp/0060929642">Human Accomplishment</a>, including its limitations, biases, and validation  can be found in Murray’s original book, and hence, will be not discussed here.</p>

			<h2 id="future_datasets">Future Datasets</h2>
			<p>In the future we are planning to release these new data sources that focus on different aspects of cultural production. </p>

			<h3 id="connected_history">Connected History</h3>
			<p>The Connected History data source connects historical characters based on social, professional and familial relationships. The dataset is based on data gathered from online resources, such as Freebase and The Darwin Correspondence Project, as well as data curated from books, including: Charles Darwin, A New Life by John Bowlby [5] and The Autobiography of Charles Darwin [6].</p>
			<p>The Connected History dataset was collected and harmonized by Jason Haas, Rebecca Kritsch, Shahar Ronen, Yingxiang Yang and Jia Zhang, as part of the 2012 MIT Media Lab Networks class taught by professor Hidalgo.</p>

			<h2 id="general_description"> General Description </h2>
			<p><strong>Measures of Global Historical Popularity</strong></p>
			<p>The Pantheon 1.0 data measures the global popularity of historical characters using two measures. The simpler of the two measures, which we denote as <em>L</em>, is the number of different Wikipedia language editions that have an article about a historical character. The most sophisticated measure, which we name the <em>Historical Popularity Index (HPI)</em> corrects <em>L</em> by adding information on the age of the historical character—as a proxy for breaking the barrier of time—the concentration of PageViews among different languages—to discount characters with PageViews mostly in a few languages—the coefficient of variation in PageViews—to discount characters that have short periods of popularity—and the number of non-english Wikipedia pageviews—to reduce any English bias even further. </p>
			<p><em>Number of Language Editions L</em></p>
			<p>The Number of Language editions measure <em>L</em> lets us focus on historical characters that have achieved global cultural popularity, as expressed in the documentation of these biographies in a large number of languages. The L>25 threshold also helps us exclude characters that have high local popularity but little global popularity. Examples of biographies with high <em>L</em> include characters of enormous historical weight, such as Isaac Newton, Van Gogh and Aristotle, who have articles in more than 150 Wikipedia language editions, but also more recent contributors to global culture such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Albert Camus or Pablo Neruda, who have articles in more than 50 Wikipedia language editions. Example of popular forms of local culture that do not make the L>25 cut include American football players, in the case of the U.S. or the T.V. comedian Chespirito in the case of Mexico (L=11). </p>
			<p><em>The Historical Popularity Index (HPI)</em></p>
			<p>The second, and more complex measure of cultural popularity, combines information on the number of languages <em>L</em>, with the effective number of languages L<sup>*</sup>, the age of the historical character <em>A</em>, the number of PageViews in Non-English Wikipedias v<sup>NE</sup> since 2008, and the coefficient of variation in PageViews in all languages between 2008 and 2013 <em>CV</em>. </p>
			<p>Technically, for each biography <em>i</em> we define each of these variables as:</p>
			<p>L<sub>i</sub> = Number of different language editions in which the biography is present.</p>
			<p>L<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup> = Effective number of languages</p>
			<p>$$L_i^* = exp(H_i)$$</p>
			<p>where \(H_i\) is the entropy defined in terms of pageviews.</p>
			<p>$$H_i=\sum_j\frac{v_{ij}}{\sum_i v_{ij}}*-ln(\frac{v_{ij}}{\sum_i v_{ij}})$$</p>
			<p>and \(v_{ij}\) is the total number of pageviews of historical character <em>i</em> in language <em>j</em>. In simple terms \(L_i^*\) provides us with the number of different languages associated with a biography after taking into account the concentration of pageviews in each language. For instance, a historical character with \(L\)=100 but with 99.9% of her pageviews in one language would have a \(L^*\)~1, since the high concentration of pageviews means that she has a presence mostly in one language. By the same token, a historical character with \(L\)=100 but with pageviews distributed evenly among all languages will have an \(L^*\)=100.</p>
			<p>\(A\)=Age of the historical character, defined simply as 2013 – Year of Birth.</p> 
			<p>\(CV\) =Coefficient of variation in page views, defined as:</p>
			<p>$$ {CV}_i=\frac{\sigma_i}{\mu_i}$$</p>
			<p>where \(\sigma_i\) is equal to the standard deviation in pageviews in all languages across time and \(\mu_i\) is the average.</p>
			<p>v<sup>NE</sup>=Total pageviews in non-english editions of the Wikipedia.</p>
			<p>Using these definitions we combine them in the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) using the formula:</p>
			<p>$$ HPI = ln(L) + ln(L^*) + \frac{ln(A)}{ln(4)} + ln(v^{NE}) - ln(CV)$$</p>
			<p>Going forward, we consider the <em>HPI</em> and other metrics to be refinements of the general idea that measures of <em>global</em> popularity, or impact, need to focus on accomplishments that have broken the barriers of space, time, and language. </p>
			<p><em>Historical Cultural Production Index</em></p>
			<p>At the level of countries, or cities, we aggregate the HPI of its historical characters to obtain the Historical Cultural Production Index (HCPI). Technically, the HCPI of country or location \(c\) is defined as:</p>
			<p>$${HCPI}_c = \sum_{i \in c} {HPI}_i$$</p>
			<p>Where the summation is over all of the characters \(i\) associated with location \(c\).</p>
			<p>The historical HCPI is cumulative, so the value for any period can be taken as the difference between the beginning and the end points of the period. The figure below shows the HCPI for countries over time.</p>

			<!-- ADD UPDATES -->
			<h2 id="bias_methods">Methods</h2>
			<p>Pantheon was constructed from data that we curated and collected from Freebase and Wikipedia. Both of these sources are open-source, collaborative knowledge bases that are freely available to the general public. </p>

			<p>Our dataset is centered on historical characters. Characters are annotated with a unique location—their place of birth—time period—date of birth—cultural domain, and notoriety metrics (L, HPI, etc.).</p>

			<h3 id="individuals_considered">Individuals Considered</h3>

			<p>We consider all individuals that have presence in more than 25 different language editions of the Wikipedia by May 2013. This set consists of 11,341 individuals.</p>

			<h3 id="domain_categorization">Domain Categorization</h3>

			<p>We derive the domain of an individual's cultural contribution using incomplete data and iterative curation procedures. </p>

			<p>To create this classification we used the occupation data available in Freebase, which is based on an uncontrolled vocabulary (a biography for a film director could be annotated as a “Film Director”, “Movie director”, “Director of Films” or any other natural language way of referring to that occupation). This uncontrolled vocabulary of more than 2,200 categories was mapped into a controlled vocabulary that we grouped and regrouped iteratively to create a controlled categorization containing 88 different categories. This required us to assign each individual to a single category, a task that was easy in some cases, but limiting in others. For example, Margaret Thatcher, who appears as a “chemist” and a “politician”, was assigned “politician” as her primary category. This was an easy call to make. We listed Isaac Newton, on the other hand,  as a “physicist”, although a mathematician category would also be correct for many of his important contributions. This is a limitation given the large number of polymaths in the data. Yet, we decided to avoid using a polymath category because it represents a “slippery slope”. By a slippery slope we mean that one could almost always draw the polymath line a bit further and include more biographies in the polymath category, making the boundary of such a mixed category unclear. The use of a primary cultural domain for each individual also helps avoid double counting. Using multiple categories for an individual is something we will reconsider in the future, but that is not part of this first dataset. </p>

			<p>The interactive figure below shows the three levels of cultural classifications as well as the number of individuals within each category.</p>
			<p><b>Figure 2: Historical Cultural Production Index over time</b></p>
			<div id="classtree"></div>

			<p>Since we are introducing a new categorization of cultural domains (which you can refer to as the Pantheon 1.0 nomenclature), it is important to highlight some conventions that are not necessarily self-explanatory. The most important of these is the “Politician” category, which we used to include all individuals that had power over policies, whether these were presidents, pharaohs, emperors, ministers or state governors. We chose the word politician, in relation to policies, rather than the word leader because there are leaders that do not have direct influence or power on policy (i.e. leaders of an artistic movement). Going forward, we are open to continue to revise this categorization system to help improve the quality of the data and the results obtained from it.</p>

			<h3 id="location_assignment">Location assignment</h3>

			<p>We assigned each individual to a standardized geographic location through a procedure that included incomplete datasets, algorithmic completion of these datasets, and refinement of these datasets through manual curation. </p>

			<p>We began the location assignment procedure by collecting the city and nationality information from freebase. This is an incomplete dataset based on an uncontrolled vocabulary--for instance an individual's city of birth could be labeled as new york, New York, New York City, or Manhattan, N.Y. We normalized the vocabulary in the data using various web geocoding APIs (including Yahoo Placemaker, Google Maps, and geonames.org) and mapped individuals born in historical locales to the countries where those cities are are currently located–-for example, we mapped individuals born in Moscow during the Soviet Union to Moscow, Russia. Finally, we manually curated the dataset to correct for the errors of the automated procedures.</p>

			<p>We understand that assigning individuals to their location based on their place of birth is highly controversial, even though the goal of the procedure is simplicity rather than controversy. The procedure was also chosen for convenience, since as of now, given our throughput and capacities, we have no other way to feasible map more than 11 thousand biographies to locations with little to no margin of error. In the future, we hope to consider the life trajectory of individuals, and the places where they made their contributions, but this will not be part of Pantheon 1.0. </p>

			<p>We agree that the assignment of locations based on place of birth is rife with assignments that could be considered controversial. Ataturk is associated with Greece, because he was born on the city of Thessaloniki that is part of present day Greece. The Chilean writer Isabel Allende is associated with Peru, since she was born in Lima. The biologist Peter Medawar is associated with Brazil since he was born in Rio, although he did not live in Brazil for long. We acknowledge these as limitations of our dataset, but also, understand that they do not provide the bulk of its signal.</p>

			<h2 id="biases_and_limitations">Biases and Limitations</h2>

			<p>This section describes the biases and limitations of the Pantheon 1.0 data. These are limitations that should be considered carefully when interpreting the results. By acknowledging these limitations we make clear that <strong>we do not propose this method to represent an unbiased view of the world</strong>. On the contrary, as all large data collection efforts, it is an effort that is punctuated by limitations and biases. Hence, <strong>we interpret this dataset narrowly, as the view of global cultural production that emerges from the multilingual expression of historical figures in the Wikipedia as of May 2013</strong>. </p>
			<p>We also note that biases are not always bad news. In some cases, biases just introduce noise, and could be compared to the optical aberrations of a telescope. In other cases, biases can be informative about the processes that affect the notoriety of historical characters, and hence, can help us understand the processes that bias the attention we give to some cultural groups. In this section, however, we will not discuss the implications of each bias and limitation in our dataset, but simply, will describe and classify all of the biases that are part of this data collection effort.</p>
			<p>Going forward we classify the biases and limitation in six categories. These are biases coming from </p>

			<ul>
				<li>1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source. </li>
				<li>2. The use of place of birth to assign locations.</li>
				<li>3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture.</li>
				<li>4. Other technical limitations.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="use_of_wikipedia">1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source</h3>

			<p>Our data is limited by the set of people who contribute to Wikipedia. We do not consider Wikipedia editors to be a representative sample of the world population, but a sample of publicly minded knowledge specialists that are willing to dedicate time and effort to contribute to the online documentation of knowledge. Wikipedia editors have an English Bias, a Western Bias, and they tend to be highly educated and computer savvy. They are also more prevalent among richer countries with Internet access. We remind the reader, however, that by using data from all Wikipedia language editions we are effectively reducing a bias that would favor the local culture of English speakers. As an example of the Anti-English bias of this methodology, we note that there is only one American Football Player in the dataset: O.J. Simpson. Certainly, his global notoriety is not purely from his football career, showing that the use of many languages reduces the English bias of the dataset (since famous American Football players, such as Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Joe Montana have a large presence in the English Wikipedia, but fail to make the L>25 cut).</p>

			<h3 id="use_of_place_of_birth">2. The use of place of birth to assign locations</h3>

			<p>Individuals were assigned to geographic locations using their place of birth. Since neither Freebase nor Wikipedia have comprehensive date of birth data, the places of birth assignments were complemented with geocoding APIs for normalization and manual curation (to correct for errors in API and completeness).</p>

			<p>Place of birth is one way of assigning a location to an individual that allow us to assign locations in a comprehensive manner. Yet, there are biases and limitations that need to be considered when using this location assignment method. An important limitation is the inability to include cultural re-exports. Would Neruda, Picasso or Hemingway be as famous if they had not participated of the Parisian art scene? The place where an individual was born is often different from the place where that individual made his or her more important contributions. In some case, the contributions are made in a number of places, and the use of places of births is unable to capture where the contributions were made. This is particularly true for athletes who migrate to the world’s most competitive leagues, or artists that move to the artistic centers of their time. In this dataset, such cultural re-exports are not represented since programmatically geo-coding birthplaces is easier and more reliable than registering the place where each individual made his or her more significant contribution--which is unstructured data hidden in narratives.</p>

			<h3 id="use_of_biographies">3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture</h3>

			<p>Using biographies to approximate cultural expressions excludes accomplishments where there isn’t a clear connection between a cultural expression and an author or creator. These are collective enterprises, where the accomplishments are the results of teams and not isolated individuals.  Examples of team accomplishments that are likely to get excluded include music bands or orchestras, when the most notorious individuals has a notoriety that is much smaller than that of the band, or the products produced by a firm, where the accolades collected from accomplishments are connected to a firm, or brand, rather than to an individual.</p>

			<h3 id="other_technical_limitations">4. Other Technical Limitations</h3>

			<p>Other biases and limitations include the volatility of Wikipedia and other online resources, which make the results presented here imperfectly reproducible. </p>

			<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

			<h3 id="validation_with_formula_one">Validation with Human Accomplishments</h3>

			<p>We present a validation of the Pantheon 1.0 dataset based on a comparison with the Human Accomplishments (HA) dataset, an independent compilation of 3,869 notable people in the arts and sciences from 800BC to AD 1950 [4]. Unlike Pantheon, HA is based on printed encyclopedias and not online sources, but like Pantheon, HA values the presence of a biography in resources in multiple languages. Since HA is restricted to the arts and sciences domains, it does not include politicians like Julius Caesar, religious figures like Jesus, racecar drivers like Ayrton Senna or chess grandmasters like Gary Kasparov. Nevertheless, we find that our data overlaps significantly with the Human Accomplishment data. The Pantheon dataset contains 1,570 (40%) of the entries available in the Human Accomplishment dataset. The HA dataset is more regionally focused than Pantheon, and we find that many of the individuals in the HA dataset are more locally impactful in their respective geographies, and hence, have a presence in fewer languages in Wikipedia. If we lower the threshold of the Pantheon dataset to include biographies existing in 10 or more languages (<em>L</em> ≥ 10) we would find an overlap of 2,878 biographies, or 74% of the HA dataset.</p>

			<p>We find a positive and significant correlation between the measures of historical impact advanced in both of these datasets. HA gives individuals a relative score that measures their impact on their respective domain. Figure 4 shows the correlation between the measures of historical impact in both Pantheon and HA. The historical impact measures in Pantheon correlate with the number of language editions in Wikipedia (L) with an R<sup>2</sup>=18% (p-value &lt; 2x10 <sup>-70</sup>) and with the HPI index with an R<sup>2</sup>=12% (p-value=1.6x10<sup>-44</sup>). Note that unlike Pantheon, HA may classify an individual into multiple domains, with a different score for each one: e.g., Galileo Galilei is classified as an astronomer (with a score of 100 that puts him as the most influential astronomer of all time) as well a physicist (ranking fifth with a score of 83).</p>

			<h3>Validation with External Measures of Accomplishment</h3>

			<p>Following an approach similar to that of Murray (2003), we also validate our dataset by using external measures of individual accomplishments when these are available. Unfortunately, many cultural domains are not characterized by external metrics of accomplishment that we can associate to individuals, so we restrict our validation to cultural domains where measures of individual accomplishment are available – namely, individual sports. The achievements of individual sportsmen and women can be quantitatively expressed through measures such as number of championship titles won or points scored. Here, we focus on Formula-1 drivers, tennis players, swimmers and chess players as independent case studies that we can use to validate our metrics of global visibility.</p>
			
			<p>Consider a Formula-1 racer. Certainly, for a Formula One racer the number of Grand Prix won, or Championships, would be a better metric of accomplishment than the number of languages in the Wikipedia. Yet, since Grand Prix won is a metric that applies only for Formula-1 drivers we cannot use it for Basketball players, swimmers, musicians or scientists. While imperfect, metrics based on the online presence of characters in diverse languages represent metrics of global notoriety that can be used for a wide-range of cultural domains, and hence, can be used to generate datasets that include people from all domains of culture.</p>
			
			<p>Below, we present a validation of our dataset, and a characterization of its biases, based on three specific subsets of data. These are Formula-1 drivers, Tennis Players, Olympic Swimmers, and Chess Players. </p>
			
			<h3 id="validation_with_formula_one">Validation with Formula 1 drivers</h3>
			
			<p>First we examine the subset of the dataset containing the top 56 Formula-1 drivers, according to the number of languages in which they have a presence in Wikipedia (<em>L</em>). For each of these drivers we created an additional dataset with the number of Grand Prix Wins, Championships Won, Podiums (number of times in the top 3), Starts, and a dummy variable for Killed in Action. These variables are used to construct a statistical model explaining the multilingual presence of each driver within Wikipedia as well as each driver’s Historical Popularity Index. Since Grand Prix Wins, Championships and Podiums are highly collinear—and hence not statistically significant when used together—only Podiums are used in the final model. Since neither <em>L</em> nor <em>HPI</em> can be negative, we link the fame of biographies to the aforementioned variables using an exponential function </p>

			<p>The first model in Figure 3a explains 54% of the variance in the number of languages in which each Formula-1 driver has a presence in the Wikipedia, showing that for Formula-1 drivers the number of languages in the Wikipedia accurately tracks accomplishments discounted by time.</p>
			
			<p><b>Figure 3a: Validation of <em>L</em> using Formula 1 drivers</b></p>
			
			<figure><img src="/formula1.png"></figure>

			<p>In contrast, when analyzing the same variables with the Historical Popularity Index, we find a model (see Figure 5b) that explains 68% of the variance in the Historical Popularity Index for each Formula-1 driver. The improved fit suggests that the corrections introduced by <em>HPI</em> enhances the <em>L</em> metric and contributes an improved characterization of accomplishment for this sample of individuals.</p>

			<p><b>Figure 3b: Validation of <em>HPI</em> using Formula 1 drivers</b></p>
			
			<figure><img src="/formula1.png"></figure>
			
			<h3 id="validation_with_tennis">Validation with Tennis Players</h3>
			<p>Next, we conduct a similar analysis for Tennis Players. The Tennis player subset focuses on the top 52 Tennis players according to the number of languages in the Wikipedia and augmented by additional data on each individual - the number of weeks he/she spent as number one in the ATP or WTA, the number of Grand Slam wins, the top rank ever obtained, and the player’s gender (Female = 1, Male = 0). </p>

			<p>For the number of language presences in Wikipedia (<em>L</em>), we construct a model which explains 34% of the variance in the multilingual presence of each of these individuals in the Wikipedia (Figure 4a). This shows that once again, the number of languages in Wikipedia is a good proxy for individual accomplishments. </p>

			<p><b>Figure 4a: Validation of <em>L</em> using Tennis Players </b></p>
			<figure><img src="/tennis.png"></figure>

			<p>When we considered <em>HPI</em>, we find an improved model that explains 63% of the variation in <em>HPI</em> (Figure 4b). This further supports the use of <em>HPI</em> as an appropriate proxy for accomplishment, since <em>HPI</em> tracks the degree of achievement for tennis players better than <em>L</em>.</p>

			<p><b>Figure 4b: Validation of <em>HPI</em> using Tennis Players </b></p>
			<figure><img src="/tennis.png"></figure>

			<h3 id="validation_with_swimmers">Validation with Swimmers</h3>
			
			<p>We also perform a similar analysis considering Olympic swimmers born after 1950. In this case, the models use the total number of medals, gold medals, gender and time from last medal. In Figure 5a, the model explains 74% of the variance observed in the total number of languages that a swimmer has a presence in Wikipedia, demonstrating that this measure is a good proxy for measuring accomplishment for swimmers.</p>
			
			<p><b>Figure 5a: Validation of <em>L</em> using Swimmers</b></p>
			<figure><img src="/swimmers.png"></figure>

			<p>When we perform the analysis for Historical Popularity Index, we find that the model explains 50% of the variance observed in the <em>HPI</em> for swimmers. Figure 5b shows the second model, which shows that <em>HPI</em> is also an appropriate proxy for quantifying accomplishment for swimmers, although in this case, <em>HPI</em> is not superior to <em>L</em>.</p>

			<p><b>Figure 5b: Validation of <em>HPI</em> using Swimmers</b></p>
			<figure><img src="/swimmers.png"></figure>

			<h3 id="validation_with_chess">Validation with Chess Players</h3>
			<p>Finally, we perform another analysis using all of the individuals classified as chess players in the Pantheon dataset. In this case, we use data on each individual’s highest ELO ranking attained, gender, total games played, and percentage of wins, losses, and draws. For the number of language presences in Wikipedia (L), we construct a model that explains 37% of the variance in the multilingual presence of each of these individuals in the Wikipedia (Figure 6a). This further supports using the number of languages in Wikipedia as a proxy for individual accomplishments. </p>

			<p>Using HPI (Figure 6b), we find a model that explains 53% of the variation in <em>HPI</em>—demonstrating that <em>HPI</em> is an appropriate proxy for accomplishment, with an improved fit for tracking an individual’s achievements.</p>

			<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
			<p>We introduced a dataset on historical impact that can be used to study spatial and temporal variations in cultural production based on biographies that have a presence in more than 25 language editions of Wikipedia. This manually verified dataset allowed us to link cultural domains (based on a classification we also introduced), to places and time. To distinguish between biographies with different levels of visibility we introduce two measures of historical impact: the number of languages in which an individual has a presence in Wikipedia (<em>L</em>), and the Historical Popularity Index (<em>HPI</em>). We validated the Pantheon dataset by comparing it against the Human Accomplishments dataset and also validated our measures of global fame and visibility using external data on the accomplishments of Formula One racecar drivers, tennis players, swimmers, and chess players. In all these cases we find a good match between L, HPI, and the external measures of accomplishment, demonstrating the validity of the measures developed within Pantheon as measures of historical impact. While these case studies are not exhaustive across all cultural domains, they show that the measures introduced are effective metrics for characterizing cultural production across diverse sets of domains, time, and geography.</p>
			
			<p>With this analysis we conclude our description of the dataset collected as well as its biases and validation. As we mentioned in the beginning, this is a live dataset that we are looking to expand in the future, so we appreciate any comments and suggestions you might have to help us improve the value of this resource. You can direct your questions, comments and suggestions to <a href="mailto:pantheon@media.mit.edu">pantheon(at)media(dot)mit(dot)edu</a>.</p>

			<h1 id="resources">Additional Resources</h1>
			<p>There are many good references and resources for those wanting to learn more about global cultural development. Below you can find a list with a few resources including literature, methods and datasets from a number of disciplines and authors. If you find that there is a resource that is missing, please be constructive and send us an email with a reference or link to the resource together with a brief summary of the contribution. That way, we can add it to this page. You can reach us easily at <a href="mailto:pantheon@media.mit.edu">pantheon(at)media(dot)mit(dot)edu</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
			<p>Rob Boyd and Peter Richerson are an essential reference for anyone interested in the topic of culture and its importance for the development of our species. Their recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-Genes-Alone-Transformed-Evolution/dp/0226712125">Not By Genes Alone (2008)</a> is a good place to get started with their work [2]. Additional references and material can be found in their personal homepages (<a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Publications.htm">Boyd UCLA page</a> and <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/Richerson.htm">Peter Richerson UC Davis Page</a>)</p>

			<h2>Mathematical Models of Cultural Evolution</h2>
			<p>Do you think the study of culture could benefit from mathematical models, such as coupled differential equations? Then, look no further than Luigi Cavalli-Sforza classic work on the topic. Whether you are interested in the transmission of lastnames or religious preferences you will find a model complete with derivations in his 1981 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Transmission-Evolution-Luigi-Cavalli-Sforza/dp/0691082839/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1386531705&sr=1-6">Cultural Transmission and Evolution</a> [7]. L.L. Cavalli-Sforza was a prolific author who wrote extensively about the evolution of culture as well as the estimation of phylogenetic trees and the spread of human populations, so if you are interested in this topic please do not hesitate to dive into this <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=LL+cavalli-sforza&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C22">stream of literature</a>.</p>

			<h2>Quantitative Estimates of Cultural Production</h2>
			<p>Prior to the release of the dataset we are making available in this site, the largest linked dataset on cultural development and human accomplishments produced was that published by Charles Murray in his (2003) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Accomplishment-Charles-Murray-ebook/dp/B000OVLJSC/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1386532321&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=huma+accomplishment">Human Accomplishment</a>[4]. Murray collected information from a number of linguistic sources from both the East and West and made this data available, together with a description of the data collection method, in his 2003 book. The book is an essential reference for anyone looking to work or study quantitative approaches estimating the level of cultural production for different regions and eras.</p>

			<h2>Culturomics</h2>
			<p>The work on n-grams by <a href="http://www.erez.com/">Erez Lieberman</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rNL5rRIAAAAJ&hl=en">Jean-Baptiste Michel</a> has become well known among those working at the intersection of big data, networks, computer science and culture. The work looks at the n-grams (collections of n-characters) contained within the google books collection[8]. You can explore the n-gram viewer by visiting this <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">link</a>.</p>

			<h2>Works using Wikipedia to Study Culture</h2>

			<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0074554">Eom and Shepelyansky</a> (2013) used Wikipedia to try to determine whether the fame of historical characters is local or global [9].</p>

			<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3799">Aragon et al.</a> (2012) used Wikipedia to study differences in the links between biographies in different language editions [10].</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.whoisbigger.com/">Skiena and Ward</a> (2013) used the English Wikipedia to create rankings of important historical characters and topics.[11]</p>

			<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5566">Yasseri et al.</a> (2013) used the Wikipedia to study the topics that are more controversial in each language.[12]</p>
