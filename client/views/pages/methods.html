			<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

			<p>Pantheon is a project developed by the Macro Connection's group at The MIT Media Lab that's collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data on historical cultural popularity and production.</p>

			<p>Because of the diversity of cultural production, Pantheon will always be—by construction—an incomplete resource. This incompleteness, however, is the fuel that drives our team to continue compiling, refining, analyzing, and visualizing new sources of data.</p>

			<p>To make our efforts tractable, Pantheon will not focus on culture, as it is understood in its broadest sense, but on cultural production. In a broad sense, culture can be understood as all of the information that humans—or animals [1]—generate and transmit through non-genetic means [2]. At Pantheon, however, we do not focus on the entire range of cultural information, but in a subset of this information that we define narrowly as cultural production. That is, we do not focus on cultural information such as passed on family values or societal trust [3], but on cultural production as proxied by the biographies of notable historical characters. Moreover, we focus on the subset of cultural production that we can identify as <strong>global</strong> culture, meaning the subset of cultural production that has broken the barriers of space, time and language. By focusing on global culture we do not deny the existence of importance of local culture, but simply, choose to focus on global culture because it is a subset of the world’s cultural production that is relatively small, easy to map and of clear importance. </p>

			<p>The version 1.0 Pantheon—available starting January 2014—builds on two data sources, but was constructed to accommodate future data sources. The two data sources included in this first version are:</p>

			<p><h2 id="data_source_1">Data Source 1:</h3> The Pantheon Multilingual Wikipedia Expression Dataset (or Pantheon Data 1.0) by Amy Yu, Kevin Hu, Shahar Ronen, Defne Gurel and Cesar A. Hidalgo (2013)</p>

			<p>The Pantheon 1.0 data was curated by the creators of Pantheon and gathers information on the 11,340 biographies that have presence in more than 25 languages in the Wikipedia (as of May 2013). This dataset is not restricted to any cultural domain or time period, including all biographies that are present in at least 25 different language editions of Wikipedia.</p>

			<p>The creation of the Pantheon 1.0 dataset included connecting each biography to a location using the country where the city of birth is presently located. Biographies were also connected to their date of birth—or an approximate date of birth when an exact date was not available—and a cultural domain, based on a categorization we developed specifically for this dataset. Details about the biases, limitations, coverage and validation of this dataset are described below.</p>

			<p><h2 id="data_source_2">Data Source 2:</h3> Human Accomplishment. The pursuit of excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800BC to 1950. By Charles Murray (2003) [4] </p>
			<p>Human Accomplishment is a book and a data compilation effort containing information on 4,002 eminent individuals from the arts and sciences who made a significant contribution prior to 1950. The inventories were constructed by Charles Murray using linguistic records—such as encyclopedia entries—from a number of different languages and sources. Human Accomplishment connects each of these historical figures to a location, time and cultural domain, albeit does so using a different methodology than the one we use for the Pantheon 1.0 data. </p>
			<p>During the data compilation face of the Pantheon project we connected both datasets at the level of individuals—a.k.a. historical figures.</p>
			<p>Details about the data in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Accomplishment-Pursuit-Excellence-Sciences/dp/0060929642">Human Accomplishment</a>, including its limitations, biases, and validation  can be found in Murray’s original book, and hence, will be not discussed here.</p>

			<h2 id="future_datasets">Future Datasets</h2>
			<p>In the near future we are planning to release these new data sources that focus on different aspects of cultural production. </p>

			<h3 id="connected_history">Connected History</h3>
			<p>The Connected History data source connects historical characters based on social, professional and familial relationships. The dataset is based on data gathered from online resources, such as Freebase and The Darwin Correspondence Project, as well as data curated from books, including: Charles Darwin, A New Life by John Bowlby [5] and The Autobiography of Charles Darwin [6].</p>
			<p>The Connected History dataset was collected and harmonized by Jason Haas, Rebecca Kritsch, Shahar Ronen, Yingxiang Yang and Jia Zhang, as part of the 2012 MIT Media Lab Networks class taught by professor Hidalgo.</p>

			<h2 id="general_description"> General Description </h2>
			<p><strong>Measures of Global Historical Popularity</strong></p>
			<p>The Pantheon 1.0 data measures the global popularity of historical characters using two measures. The simpler of the two measures, which we denote as <em>L</em>, is the number of different Wikipedia language editions that have an article about a historical character. The most sophisticated measure, which we name the <em>Historical Popularity Index (HPI)</em> corrects <em>L</em> by adding information on the age of the historical character—as a proxy for breaking the barrier of time—the concentration of PageViews among different languages—to discount characters with PageViews mostly in a few languages—the coefficient of variation in PageViews—to discount characters that have short periods of popularity—and the number of non-english Wikipedia pageviews—to reduce any English bias even further. </p>
			<p><em>Number of Language Editions L</em></p>
			<p>The Number of Language editions measure <em>L</em> let's us focus on historical characters that have achieved global cultural popularity, as expressed in the documentation of these biographies in a large number of languages. The L>25 threshold also helps us exclude characters that have high local popularity but little global popularity. Examples of biographies with high <em>L</em> include characters of enormous historical weight, such as Isaac Newton, Van Gogh and Aristotle, who have articles in more than 150 Wikipedia language editions, but also more recent contributors to global culture such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Albert Camus or Pablo Neruda, who have articles in more than 50 Wikipedia language editions. Example of popular forms of local culture that do not make the L>25 cut include American football players, in the case of the U.S. or the T.V. comedian Chespirito in the case of Mexico (L=11). </p>
			<p><em>The Historical Popularity Index (HPI)</em></p>
			<p>The second, and more complex measure of cultural popularity, combines information on the number of languages <em>L</em>, with the effective number of languages L<sup>*</sup>, the age of the historical character <em>A</em>, the number of PageViews in Non-English Wikipedias v<sup>NE</sup> since 2008, and the coefficient of variation in PageViews in all languages between 2008 and 2013 <em>CV</em>. </p>
			<p>Technically, for each biography <em>i</em> we define each of these variables as:</p>
			<p>L<sub>i</sub> = Number of different language editions in which the biography is present.</p>
			<p>L<sub>i</sub><sup>*</sup> = Effective number of languages</p>
			<p>$$L_i^* = exp(H_i)$$</p>
			<p>where \(H_i\) is the entropy defined in terms of pageviews.</p>
			<p>$$H_i=\sum_j\frac{v_{ij}}{\sum_i v_{ij}}ln(\frac{v_{ij}}{\sum_i v_{ij}})$$</p>
			<p>and \(v_{ij}\) is the total number of pageviews of historical character <em>i</em> in language <em>j</em>. In simple terms \(L_i^*\) provides us with the number of different languages associated with a biography after taking into account the concentration of pageviews in each language. For instance, a historical character with \(L\)=100 but with 99.9% of her pageviews in one language would have a \(L^*\)~1, since the high concentration of pageviews means that she has a presence mostly in one language. By the same token, a historical character with \(L\)=100 but with pageviews distributed evenly among all languages will have an \(L^*\)=100.</p>
			<p>\(A\)=Age of the historical character, defined simply as 2013 – Year of Birth.</p> 
			<p>\(CV\) =Coefficient of variation in page views, defined as:</p>
			<p>$$ {CV}_i=\frac{\sigma_i}{\mu_i}$$</p>
			<p>where \(\sigma_i\) is equal to the standard deviation in pageviews in all languages across time and \(\mu_i\) is the average.</p>
			<p>v<sup>NE</sup>=Total pageviews in non-english editions of the Wikipedia.</p>
			<p>Using these definitions we combine them in the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) using the formula:</p>
			<p>$$ HPI = ln(L) + ln(L^*) + \frac{ln(A)}{ln(4)} + ln(v^{NE}) - ln(CV)$$</p>
			<p>Going forward, we consider the <em>HPI</em> and other metrics to be refinements of the general idea that measures of <em>global</em> popularity, or impact, need to focus on accomplishments that have broken the barriers of space, time, and language. </p>
			<p><em>Historical Cultural Production Index</em></p>
			<p>At the level of countries, or cities, we aggregate the HPI of its historical characters to obtain the Historical Cultural Production Index (HCPI). Technically, the HCPI of country or location \(c\) is defined as:</p>
			<p>$${HCPI}_c = \sum_{i \in c} {HPI}_i$$</p>
			<p>Where the summation is over all of the characters \(i\) associated with location \(c\).</p>
			<p>The historical HCPI is cumulative, so the value for any period can be taken as the difference between the beginning and the end points of the period. The figure below shows the HCPI for countries over time.</p>
			<p><b>Figure 1: Historical Cultural Production Index over time</b></p>
			<figure><img src="images/CivChart_Pantheon.png"></figure>
			<!-- ADD UPDATES -->
			<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
			<p>Pantheon was constructed from data that we curated and collected from Freebase and Wikipedia. Both of these sources are open-source, collaborative knowledge bases that are freely available to the general public. </p>

			<p>Our dataset is centered on historical characters. Characters are annotated with a unique location—their place of birth—time period—date of birth—cultural domain, and notoriety metrics (L, HPI, etc.).</p>

			<h3 id="individuals_considered">Individuals Considered</h3>

			<p>We consider all individuals that have presence in at least 25 different language editions of the Wikipedia by May 2013. This set consists of 11,340 individuals.</p>

			<h3 id="domain_categorization">Domain Categorization</h3>

			<p>We derive the domain of an individual's cultural contribution using incomplete data and iterative curation procedures. </p>

			<p>To create this classification we used the occupation data available in Freebase, which is based on an uncontrolled vocabulary (a biography for a film director could be annotated as a “Film Director”, “Movie director”, “Director of Films” or any other natural language way of referring to that occupation). This uncontrolled vocabulary of more than 2,200 categories was mapped into a controlled vocabulary that we grouped and regrouped iteratively to create a controlled categorization containing 95 different categories. This required us to assign each individual to a single category, a task that was easy in some cases, but limiting in others. For example, Margaret Thatcher, who appears as a “chemist” and a “politician”, was assigned “politician” as her primary category. This was an easy call to make. We listed Isaac Newton, on the other hand,  as a “physicist”, although a mathematician category would also be correct for many of his important contributions. This is a limitation given the large number of polymaths in the data. Yet, we decided to avoid using a polymath category because it represents a “slippery slope”. By a slippery slope we mean that one could almost always draw the polymath line a bit further and include more biographies in the polymath category, making the boundary of such a mixed category unclear. The use of a primary cultural domain for each individual also helps avoid double counting. Using multiple categories for an individual is something we will reconsider in the future, but that is not part of this first dataset. </p>

			<p>The interactive figure below shows the three levels of cultural classifications as well as the number of individuals within each category.</p>
			<p><b>Figure 2: Historical Cultural Production Index over time</b></p>
			<div id="classtree"></div>

			<p>Since we are introducing a new categorization of cultural domains (which you can refer to as the Pantheon 1.0 nomenclature), it is important to highlight some conventions that are not necessarily self-explanatory. The most important of these is the “Politician” category, which we used to include all individuals that had power over policies, whether these were presidents, pharaohs, emperors, ministers or state governors. We chose the word politician, in relation to policies, rather than the word leader because there are leaders that do not have direct influence or power on policy (i.e. leaders of an artistic movement). Going forward, we are open to continue to revise this categorization system to help improve the quality of the data and the results obtained from it.</p>

			<h3 id="location_assignment">Location assignment</h3>

			<p>We assigned each individual to a standardized geographic location through a procedure that included incomplete datasets, algorithmic completion of these datasets, and refinement of these datasets through manual curation. </p>

			<p>We began the location assignment procedure by collecting the city and nationality information from freebase. This is an incomplete dataset based on an uncontrolled vocabulary--for instance an individual's city of birth could be labeled as new york, New York, New York City, or Manhattan, N.Y. We normalized the vocabulary in the data using various web geocoding APIs (including Yahoo Placemaker, Google Maps, and geonames.org) and mapped individuals born in historical locales to the countries where those cities are are currently located–-for example, we mapped individuals born in Moscow during the Soviet Union to Moscow, Russia. Finally, we manually curated the dataset to correct for the errors of the automated procedures.</p>

			<p>We understand that assigning individuals to their location based on their place of birth is highly controversial, even though the goal of the procedure is simplicity rather than controversy. The procedure was also chosen for convenience, since as of now, given our throughput and capacities, we have no other way to feasible map more than 11 thousand biographies to locations with little to no margin of error. In the future, we hope to consider the life trajectory of individuals, and the places where they made their contributions, but this will not be part of Pantheon 1.0. </p>

			<p>We agree that the assignment of locations based on place of birth is rife with assignments that could be considered controversial. Ataturk is associated with Greece, because he was born on the city of Thessaloniki that is part of present day Greece. The Chilean writer Isabel Allende is associated with Peru, since she was born in Lima. The biologist Peter Medawar is associated with Brazil since he was born in Rio, although he did not live in Brazil for long. We acknowledge these as limitations of our dataset, but also, understand that they do not provide the bulk of its signal.</p>

			<h2 id="biases_and_limitations">Biases and Limitations</h2>

			<p>This section describes the biases and limitations of the Pantheon 1.0 data. These are limitations that should be considered carefully when interpreting the results. By acknowledging these limitations we make clear that <strong>we do not propose this method to represent an unbiased view of the world</strong>. On the contrary, as all large data collection efforts, it is an effort that is punctuated by limitations and biases. Hence, <strong>we interpret this dataset narrowly, as the view of global cultural production that emerges from the multilingual expression of historical figures in the Wikipedia as of May 2013</strong>. </p>
			<p>We also note that biases are not always bad news. In some cases, biases just introduce noise, and could be compared to the optical aberrations of a telescope. In other cases, biases can be informative about the processes that affect the notoriety of historical characters, and hence, can help us understand the processes that bias the attention we give to some cultural groups. In this section, however, we will not discuss the implications of each bias and limitation in our dataset, but simply, will describe and classify all of the biases that are part of this data collection effort.</p>
			<p>Going forward we classify the biases and limitation in six categories. These are biases coming from </p>

			<ul>
				<li>1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source. </li>
				<li>2. The use of place of birth to assign locations.</li>
				<li>3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture.</li>
				<li>4. Temporal biases.</li>
				<li>5. Other technical limitations.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="use_of_wikipedia">1. The use of Wikipedia as a data source</h3>

			<p>Our data is limited by the set of people who contribute to Wikipedia. We do not consider Wikipedia editors to be a representative sample of the world population, but a sample of publicly minded knowledge specialists that are willing to dedicate time and effort to contribute to the online documentation of knowledge. Wikipedia editors have an English Bias, a Western Bias, and they tend to be highly educated and computer savvy. They are also more prevalent among richer countries with Internet access. We remind the reader, however, that by using data from all Wikipedia language editions we are effectively reducing a bias that would favor the local culture of English speakers. As an example of the Anti-English bias of this methodology, we note that there is only one American Football Player in the dataset: O.J. Simpson. Certainly, his global notoriety is not purely from his football career, showing that the use of many languages reduces the English bias of the dataset (since famous American Football players, such as Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Joe Montana have a large presence in the English Wikipedia, but fail to make the L>25 cut).</p>

			<p>Wikipedia also has an important bias in the inclusion of people from different categories. This bias could be the result of the notoriety criteria in Wikipedia being more lax for individuals in some categories than others, or from the Wikipedia community.  For instance, we note that Spanish Wikipedia has entries for 78% of the players in the Chilean soccer club Unión Española, and 43% of the players from the second division team Magallanes, but only for 5.5% of the faculty at MIT. This suggests that the inclusion criteria in Wikipedia might be more lax for sportsmen than academics, since being a player in a second division team in Chile is more likely to pass the notoriety criteria required by Wikipedia Editors than being a faculty at MIT.</p>

			<h3 id="use_of_place_of_birth">2. The use of place of birth to assign locations</h3>

			<p>Individuals were assigned to geographic locations using their place of birth. Since neither Freebase nor Wikipedia have comprehensive date of birth data, the places of birth assignments were complemented with geocoding APIs for normalization and manual curation (to correct for errors in API and completeness).</p>

			<p>Place of birth is one way of assigning a location to an individual that allow us to assign locations in a comprehensive manner. Yet, there are biases and limitations that need to be considered when using this location assignment method. An important limitation is the inability to include cultural re-exports. Would Neruda, Picasso or Hemingway be as famous if they had not participated of the Parisian art scene? The place where an individual was born is often different from the place where that individual made his or her more important contributions. In some case, the contributions are made in a number of places, and the use of places of births is unable to capture where the contributions were made. This is particularly true for athletes who migrate to the world’s most competitive leagues, or artists that move to the artistic centers of their time. In this dataset, such cultural re-exports are not represented since programmatically geo-coding birthplaces is easier and more reliable than registering the place where each individual made his or her more significant contribution--which is unstructured data hidden in narratives.</p>

			<h3 id="use_of_biographies">3. The use of biographies as proxies for culture</h3>

			<p>Using biographies to approximate cultural expressions excludes accomplishments where there isn’t a clear connection between a cultural expression and an author or creator. These are collective enterprises, where the accomplishments are the results of teams and not isolated individuals.  Examples of team accomplishments that are likely to get excluded include music bands or orchestras, when the most notorious individuals has a notoriety that is much smaller than that of the band, or the products produced by a firm, where the accolades collected from accomplishments are connected to a firm, or brand, rather than to an individual.</p>

			<h3 id="temporal_biases">4. Temporal biases</h3>

			<p>The dataset has an important recency bias (a bias towards more recent characters). To illustrate and document this recency bias we show three datasets in which we consider individuals with a “similar” level of accomplishment. These are Chilean president, “pichicis”—top scorers of the Spanish Liga, and the winners of the best actress award at the Oscars. All three data series demonstrate a positive correlation between the number of languages where these individuals have a presence and the year of their birth, indicating that the dataset is biased in favor of more recent individuals. More details about the recency bias can be found in the validation section below. We note that the HPI and HCPI metrics include the age of historical characters as a mean to control for this recency bias. </p>

			<p>The recency bias is interesting in the sense that it represents a bias of the Internet as new media. Certainly, people whose fame coincided with the existence of the Internet will be overrepresented in the Wikipedia. Hence, the bias can be understood as a combination of both, a bias for recency, but also, a bias of the media available at the time in which the individual became notorious for a contribution (if the Wikipedia had existed in the early eighties probably Cindi Lauper would have a higher presence).</p>

			<h3 id="other_technical_limitations">5. Other Technical Limitations</h3>

			<p>Other biases and limitations include the volatility of Wikipedia, which makes the results presented here imperfectly reproducible. </p>
			<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
			<p>Is the number of different languages in which a historical figure has a presence in the Wikipedia indicative of individual accomplishment, or is it just a superficial measure of fame? Following an approach similar to that of Murray (2003), we validate our dataset by using external measures of individual accomplishments when these are available. The cases in which these metrics are most widely available are sports, where the accomplishment of individuals is expressed in championships, scores made, wins, etc.</p>
			<p>Consider a Formula-1 racer. Certainly, for a Formula One racer the number of Grand Prix won, or Championships, would be a better metric of accomplishment than the number of languages in the Wikipedia. Yet, since Grand Prix won is a metric that applies only for Formula-1 drivers we cannot use it for Basketball players, swimmers, musicians or scientists. While imperfect, metrics based on the online presence of characters in diverse languages represent metrics of global notoriety that can be used for a wide-range of cultural domains, and hence, can be used to generate datasets that include people from all domains of culture.</p>
			<p>Below, we present a validation of our dataset, and a characterization of its biases, based on three specific subsets of data. These are Formula-1 drivers, Tennis Players and Olympic Swimmers. </p>
			<h3 id="validation_with_formula_one">Validation with Formula 1 drivers</h3>
			<p>First we consider the subset of our dataset containing the top 25 Formula-1 drivers according to the number of languages in which they have a presence in the Wikipedia. For each of these drivers we created an additional dataset with the number of Grand Prix Wins, Championships Won, Podiums (number of times in the top 3), Starts, a dummy for Killed in Action, and the Time since the last F1-race. We used these variables to construct a statistical model that explained the number of languages in which each driver has a presence in the Wikipedia. Since Grand Prix Wins, Championships and Podiums are highly collinear—and hence not statistically significant when used together—we use only one of them in the final model (Podiums). Finally, we choose an exponential function linking our accomplishment variables to the number of languages in the Wikipedia L. We choose an exponential since we look for a function that is always positive (since L cannot be negative).</p>
			<p>The model presented in Figure 6 explains 87% of the variance in the number of languages in which each Formula-1 driver has a presence in the Wikipedia, showing that for Formula-1 drivers the number of languages in the Wikipedia tracks accomplishments discounted by time accurately.</p>
			<p><b>Figure 6: Validation using Formula 1 drivers</b></p>
			<figure><img src="images/formula1.png"></figure>
			<h3 id="validation_with_tennis">Validation with Tennis Players</h3>
			<p>Next we perform a similar analysis but focused on Tennis Players. The tennis player dataset has the added benefit of including both male and females, letting us study whether there is any evidence of gender bias in the multilingual presence of tennis players in the Wikipedia. For Tennis players we focus on the top 45 Tennis players according to the number of languages in the Wikipedia and collect a dataset containing the number of weeks as number one in the ATP, the number of Grand Slams wins, the top rank ever obtained, the gender (Female = 1), and the Age minus 24 (assuming 24 is peak age for tennis player). </p>
			<p>The most parsimonious model—using Grand Slam Wins, Gender and Time—explains 54% of the variance in the number of Languages each of these individuals has a presence in the Wikipedia (Figure 7). This shows that once again, the number of languages in the Wikipedia is a good proxy for individual accomplishments. We also find that the gender coefficient is negative and significant, meaning that a female at the same level of accomplishment has--on average--a presence in one less language than the equivalent male.</p>
			<p><b>Figure 7: Validation using Tennis Players </b></p>
			<figure><img src="images/tennis.png"></figure>
			<h3 id="validation_with_swimmers">Validation with Swimmers</h3>
			<p>Finally, we perform a similar analysis considering Olympic swimmers born after 1950. In this case we use the total number of medals, gold medals, gender and time from last medal for our model. The best parsimonious model for the data is obtained for gold medals, gender and time--although gender is not significant in this case, likely due to the small sample size (N=19). This model explains 74% of the variance observed in the total number of languages that a swimmer has a presence in the Wikipedia. </p>
			<p><b>Figure 8: Validation using Swimmers</b></p>
			<figure><img src="images/swimmers.png"></figure>
			<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
			<p>In sum, for the three dataset studied the number of languages that an individual has a presence in the Wikipedia represents a good proxy for their accomplishments discounted by time. The comparison of these three datasets, however, invites us to reflect on some of their commonalities and differences. </p>
			<p>First, we have the constant coefficient for the three models. This is the coefficients expressed as “A” in the equations and that account for the baseline level of notoriety in each dataset--number of languages in which individual has a presence. As we can see in figures 6-8, for Tennis the “A” coefficient is around 80, whereas for Formula-1 and swimming it is respectively 40 and 25. We can interpret A as the global level of notoriety that is associated to each cultural domain. According to this interpretation, the baseline level of notoriety of a tennis player is larger than that of a Formula-1 racer, and that in turn, is larger than that of a swimmer. The large variation in the baseline numbers suggest that there are important differences in the level of notoriety associated with each discipline, and hence, that global notoriety is mediated by the cultural domain where each individual has made his or her contribution.</p>
			<p>Second, we note that in all datasets the coefficient associated with time is negative, suggesting that the dataset is biased in favor of individuals who have made their contributions more recently. In all cases, the unit of time is years and the coefficients are of the order of 1/100 or 1/1000, meaning that for these datasets the notoriety expressed in L “erodes” at a rate by which it halves every 30 to 300 years. </p>
			<p>Finally, we note that in both of the datasets for which gender information was available we found a negative coefficient associated with gender--even though in swimming this was not statistically significant. The negative coefficient indicates that at the same level of accomplishment women receive less notoriety from men. </p>
			<p>Yet, there are two possible ways of interpreting this gender bias coefficient. One way of interpreting it is simply as a bias in favor of males. Another way of interpreting the bias is as a difference in the baseline notoriety “A” of the sub-cultural domains associated with male and female sports. Consider the case of tennis. In this case we can interpret the observed coefficient as the difference in attention received by the ATP and the WTA tournaments, as much as in racing we observe a difference between the baseline attention between Formula-1 and Nascar. To determine whether the bias observed is one based on gender, or on the existence of separate leagues that are harnessing a different baseline level of attention, we will need to collect data on cultural domains where the contributions of individuals are not done in leagues that are gender segregated. An example of such a dataset would involve the accomplishments of creative writers, since female authors and male authors participate of the same market. Certainly, having an objective measure of accomplishment will be difficult in the case of writing, but books sold or Nobel prizes could be ok proxies [7].</p>
			<p>With this analysis we conclude our description of the dataset collected as well as its biases and validation. As we mentioned in the beginning, this is a live dataset that we are looking to expand in the future, so we appreciate any comments and suggestions you might have to help us improve the value of this resource.

			<h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
			<p>Rob Boyd and Peter Richerson are an essential reference for anyone interested in the topic of culture and its importance for the development of our species. Their recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-Genes-Alone-Transformed-Evolution/dp/0226712125">Not By Genes Alone (2008)</a> is a good place to get started with their work. Additional references and material can be found in their personal homepages (<a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Publications.htm">Boyd UCLA page</a> and <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/Richerson.htm">Peter Richerson UC Davis Page</a>)</p>

			<h2>Mathematical Models of Cultural Evolution</h2>
			<p>Do you think the study of culture could benefit from mathematical models, such as coupled differential equations? Then, look no further than Luigi Cavalli-Sforza classic work on the topic. Whether you are interested in the transmission of lastnames or religious preferences you will find a model complete with derivations in his 1981 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Transmission-Evolution-Luigi-Cavalli-Sforza/dp/0691082839/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1386531705&sr=1-6">Cultural Transmission and Evolution</a>. L.L. Cavalli-Sforza was a prolific author who wrote extensively about the evolution of culture as well as the estimation of phylogenetic trees and the spread of human populations, so if you are interested in this topic please do not hesitate to dive into this <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=LL+cavalli-sforza&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C22">stream of literature</a>.</p>

			<h2>Quantitative Estimates of Cultural Production</h2>
			<p>Prior to the release of the dataset we are making available in this site, the largest linked dataset on cultural development and human accomplishments produced was that published by Charles Murray in his (2003) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Accomplishment-Charles-Murray-ebook/dp/B000OVLJSC/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1386532321&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=huma+accomplishment">Human Accomplishments</a>. Murray collected information from a number of linguistic sources from both the East and West and made this data available, together with a description of the data collection method, in his 2003 book. The book is an essential reference for anyone looking to work or study quantitative approaches estimating the level of cultural production for different regions and eras.</p>

			<h2>Culturomics</h2>
			<p>The work on n-grams by <a href="http://www.erez.com/">Erez Lieberman</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rNL5rRIAAAAJ&hl=en">Jean-Baptiste Michel</a> has become well known among those working at the intersection of big data, networks, computer science and culture. The work looks at the n-grams (collections of n-characters) contained within the google books collection.
