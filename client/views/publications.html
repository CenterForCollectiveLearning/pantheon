				<p>The development of nations is a multifaceted process that involves the dynamics of economic growth (cite books on growth), the evolution of industrial capacities (cite Products Space, Econ Complexity and Atlas), and the development of political liberties (cite Amartya Sen Development as Freedom), public services (cite Duflo and Banerjee), institutions (cite Acemoglu), and culture (cite Boyd and Richerson, cite Cavalli-Sforza).</p>

				<p>Our ability to understand the development of a nation, however, is limited by the availability of data that can be used to observe the progress of a nation in each of these dimensions. Consider the study of economic growth. In the 1930’s Simon Kuznets’ helped develop the system of national accounts and create measures of gross national product (GNP). Kuznets work  fueled decades of research connecting the dynamics of aggregate economic growth with technology (solow and ramsey), institutions (acemoglu and robinson), human capital (cite romer, cite lucas), industrial diversification (cite product space, econ complexity and atlas), incentives (easterly) and geography (cite jeff sacks).</p>

				<p>Think of the United States and the major accomplishments that define the history of this country. Is the history of the United States fully represented by its high-levels of per-capita income and by its ability to export jet engines and harvesting machines? Or would this description benefit from complementary data included accomplishments such as those embodied by the moonwalk of Neil Armstrong, the jazz of Miles Davis and the movies of Steven Spielberg? For most people a description including the latter cultural accomplishments is essential to capture a dimension of development that, while conspicuous, is presently lacking.</p>

				<p>The development of culture, however, is not an accessory to economic growth or industrial development, but a key aspect of the human experience (cite Boyd and Richerson). The development of culture, as expressed for instance in scientific and artistic accomplishments, represents the way in which our civilization expands the set of actions that are considered humanly possible. Transcontinental flight, instant video communication, vaccine therapy and refrigeration are among many of the accomplishments that have expanded the set of humanly possible activities in recent centuries and that differentiate our species from other species. Moreover, the development of these capacities is an important dimension differentiating nations. The development of the phone, light bulb and plane in the United States can rarely be considered an irrelevant aspect of the development of this prosperous country, much like the development of writing, the saddle and the wheel in ancient times was not an irrelevant accomplishment of the civilizations that spearheaded this development.</p>

				<p>Our world has changed enormously since Kuznets’s develop the original measures of GNP eighty years ago. It is a world where modern communication technologies have helped digitize large volumes of information that is rich in cultural content (cite Cultureomics) and that can be used to mine text, images and video in search for data on cultural expressions and their adoption.</p>

				<p>Chief among these sources is the Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia ever constructed, containing more than 2 million articles and having editions in more than 270 languages. While there are limitations and biases in the use of Wikipedia as a datasource (cite Reagle, Rhue 2011, etc) , it is a resource that nevertheless provides an unprecedented volume of information that can be used to study cultural development and explore the patterns of cultural diversification and development.</p>

				<p>In this paper we present a highly curated dataset containing cultural development information matching all biographies that have a presence in at least 25 language editions of the Wikipedia to a cultural domain and their place and date of birth. We use this dataset to explore four different aspects of the patterns of cultural development. First, we show that the patterns of cultural development are characterized by a strong negative relationship between the diversity of countries and the ubiquity of the cultural domains expressed, which goes beyond what is expected from chance. This relationship is analogous to the nestedness found in industry-location matrices (cite), insular habitats (cite) and mutualistic networks (cite). Second, we find the development of culture to be path dependent. On average, countries diversify by moving from the most ubiquitous forms of cultural expression—such as politics and music—to less ubiquitous cultural domains—such as sciences and invention. Third, we show that there is a strong relationship between the diversity of cultural expressions and the number of notable people associated with each country. The relationship is logarithmic, indicating that linear increases in cultural diversity are associated with changes in the order of magnitude of the number of people associated with each location. Fourth and final, we document a strong relationship between the cultural domains expressed and the media and technology available, this is in agreement with numerous theories that highlight the role of technology in culture (cite, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change). Together, these results provide a first quantitative analysis of the patterns of international cultural development revealing that this is a path dependent and highly structured process where the most idiosyncratic forms of culture depend on either on the local existence of other forms of culture, or on factors that need to be accumulated for that culture to be developed.</p>

				<h2 id="dataandmethods">Data and Methods</h2>

				<p>We measure the development of global culture by estimating the number of illustrious people associated with each city and country. We measure the illustriousness of a historical character by looking at the number of languages in which it has a presence in the Wikipedia. We find the documentation of an individual in multiple languages as a good and simple indicator of the global notoriety of his or her work, since it focuses on accomplishments that have broke successive language barriers. For simplicity, we focus on the number of languages (L), and leave for the appendix the exercise of refining these measures by incorporating information about the population of each language, or the number of page views obtained by an individual in each language.  Going forward, we restrict the study to the XXX biographies with presence in at least 25 different languages (L>25). The choice of the L>25 threshold is guided by the our ability to manually check the data, since prior to this dataset there was no dataset containing a normalized set of associations between biographies, locations, dates and cultural domains.</p>
				
				<p>The use of Wikipedia as a source of cultural data has several limitations, and we stress that the results presented here are not general, representing the narrow view that is provided by this media. The limitations of the Wikipedia include the biases associated with the demographics of its editors, which are computer literate elites, and the recency bias that favors the inclusion of people whose contribution has coincided with the existence of the encyclopedia. The latter of these biases affects primarily the datasets for the last century, but is not expected to affect the relative values obtained for biographies from the renaissance or the antiquity. A more thorough description of the biases and limitation of the use of the Wikipedia as a source of data can be found in the SM.</p>
				
				<p>The use of biographies also has limitations, since not all work can be attributed to biographies. Tracking culture through biographies—i.e. using Shakespeare as a porxy of both, Romeo and Juliette and Othello—provides a simpler way to create a comprehensive dataset of global culture, since assigning cultural domains, places of births, and dates of birth to historical characters is easier than doing so for fictional characters.</p>
				
				<p>Nevertheless the Wikipedia provides the view of an important group of individuals, especially when we consider not only its English edition but also its editions in all languages. According to this simple measures the most notorious individual of the antiquity (prior to 500 AC) are Jesus, Confucius, Aristotle, Plato and Alexander the Great. The most notorious individuals born in the first half of the 19th century are Marx, Darwin, Lincoln, Edison, Victor Hugo and Tolstoy.  The dataset can be explored interactively through a data visualization engine constructed exactly for this purpose at http://culture.media.mit.edu</p>
				
				<p>We can characterize the biases of the Wikipedia, at least with respect to previous datasets, by comparing the measure of illustriousness we obtain with those of previous efforts. A thorough compilation constructed through completely different methods is Human Accomplishment, a published volume listing 3,869 individuals that have made significant contributions to the arts and sciences before 1950 (26).  Figure XX compares our measure of illustriousness with the one published in Human Accomplishments. This comparisons shows that the measures derived from Wikipedia are negatively biased toward Asian biographies—in relation to the Human Accomplishment data—whereas the Human Accomplishment data is negatively biased against western left wing liberals, with respect to the Wikipedia data. Overall, the correlation between the two time series is mild, but highly significant, with an R2=25%, indicating an overlap in the information they carry with respect to the illustriousness of historical characters.</p>
				
				<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

				<p>Unlike other datasets, our data connects each biography with its date of birth, place of birth, cultural domain and illustriousness. This allows us to go beyond the individual and explore the patterns of cultural development of place, the places associated with each cultural domains, and the dynamics of cultural domains for each time period.</p>
