/**
 * Profound Grid
 * 
 * Built in Sass (SCSS) this responsive/adaptive grid supports both fixed and fluid layouts, 
 * relative and fixed gutters, as well as your choice of semantic markup or generic '.grid-x' classes.
 * 
 * The biggest difference to other grid systems is the use of negative margins for column
 * placements, avoiding the subpixel rounding issues that usually break/uglify fluid layouts
 * in some browsers.
 * 
 * Nested columns are supported too, without having to reset the grid on each level.
